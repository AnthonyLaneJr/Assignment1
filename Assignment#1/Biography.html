        <h2><b><ins>Childhood</ins></b></h2>
        During my elementary and middle school years my family always pushed sports onto my brother (Younger) and I. We both played <i>football, basketball, baseball, and tennis.</i> My Family believed that sports would provide structure and instill the concept of hard work into me. So even though I didn't always enjoy the sport I was playing, my parents and grandpa would make sure I gave it my all.

     <p><h2><b><ins>Adult-hood</ins></b></h2>
        Instead of following my parents wishes and attending college, I enlisted in the Army. In the summer of 2017, just following my <i>Highschool graduation</i>, I shipped off to bootcamp. <sub>My first few years in the Army were <b>extremely impactful</b>, it's safe to say that they helped mold me into the man I am today.</sub> <sup> experiences I gained and things I saw forever changed the way I viewed life, as well as my goals in life.</sup>

     <p><h2><b><ins>Present Time</ins></b></h2>
        Following my seperation from the military I decided to pursue my passion, <mark>Personal Training</mark> (highlighted). As much as I love training clients in a gym, training isn't feasible while working for a large corporation. I've refocused my efforts into learning about coding and website design; in hopes of one day owning my own web-design/IT business.</p>
